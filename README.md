# shut-it
Alexa skill to address misfires

Problem: Sometimes Alexa misfires. It talks and runs on with unhelpful information. Maybe the device mishears the wake word. Maybe it is giving an answer incorrectly as when it delivers the weather for a locale not requested. No matter the reason, sometimes I just want it to stop talking. That's when I say 'shut it'. 

Action: Create a skill where Alexa apologizes for spewing noise when it should be quiet.
